## Features

- **Multi-format extraction** — handles `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.txt` in one pass
- **NTA prefix validation** — validates against all known NTC, Ncell, Smart Cell, UTL, and Hello Mobile prefixes (verified 2025)
- **OCR for scanned PDFs** — falls back to Tesseract OCR with confidence filtering (≥60%) when no text layer is found
- **Nepali digit support** — normalizes Devanagari digits and Preeti font encodings before extraction
- **Global deduplication** — reports unique count vs. total extracted across all files
- **Drag-and-drop + folder scan** — drop a folder to recursively collect all supported files

## Found bugs

- extracting from .pdf can sometime give wrong numbers -- idk why it brings up wrong number sometimes prolly some issue in setting dpi and tesseract.

## Installation if you do not wish to use the .exe

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Tesseract OCR *(optional — scanned PDFs only)*
- Poppler for Windows *(optional — scanned PDFs only)*

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install PySide6 pandas openpyxl xlrd pdfplumber python-docx docx2txt

# Optional — for scanned PDF OCR support
pip install pdf2image pytesseract Pillow
```

### OCR setup (optional)

1. **Tesseract** — download from [UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki), install to `<project_root>/tesseract/`, and include the `nep` language pack
2. **Poppler** — download from [oschwartz10612/poppler-windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases), extract to `<project_root>/poppler/Library/bin/`

If neither is installed, the app runs normally — OCR is silently disabled.

### Run
```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Add files via **Add** or drag-and-drop files/folders onto the window
3. Click **Start**
4. Monitor the live log panel for per-file progress
5. On completion, choose a save path — output is a `.xlsx` with a single `Phone Number` column
